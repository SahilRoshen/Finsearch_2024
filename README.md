# Credit Score Modeling Algorithm
The following code generates the values required for predicting the credit score when provided the required data. This script is a full pipeline for training a logistic regression model. The steps involve loading and preprocessing the data, training the model, making predictions, and evaluating the model's performance. The preprocessing includes encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical ones. After training, the model's accuracy and other metrics are calculated and displayed, along with the modelâ€™s coefficients. <br/>
